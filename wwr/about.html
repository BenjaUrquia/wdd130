                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Argentina Rafting Expeditions made its first commercial trip on December 12, 1993 on the San Juan River, but its history begins many years before, when Martín Moreno and Rodolfo Navio met at the I.N.E.F. MENDOZA, taking the exam for the Physical Education teacher's degree.
                    The passion for the river and outdoor life brought them together, they started working in a rafting company in Potrerillos, traveled to the United States and upon their return they created their own company in the province of San Juan. At the beginning they only had 3 rafts and equipment for 18 passengers. Some time later they moved to the place where it all began, Potrerillos, Mendoza. Their first base of operations was in the facilities of the A.C.A. Campground, in a small space that the Pola family, concessionaire of the place, gave them. They set up a tent for 3 summer seasons and did not stop until they managed to build their first cabin in front of the campsite, on the banks of the Mendoza River, which was their base of operations for 10 years. With the construction of the Potrerillos Dam, the area was under water and they had to move to the site where the base operates today. It was inaugurated in November 2006 and currently has equipment for more than a hundred people in the rafting activity, fifty pieces of equipment for canopy and rappel, twenty-five mountain bikes and kayaks to cater to groups of companies and schools of students.</p>
